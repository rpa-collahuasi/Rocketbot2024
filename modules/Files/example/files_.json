And even though Dan is all grown up, the ghosts of the Overlook and his father's legacy of alcoholism and violence kept him drifting aimlessly for most of his life. Now, Dan has finally found some order in the chaos by working in a local hospice, earning the nickname Doctor Sleep by secretly using his special abilities to comfort the dying and prepare them for the afterlife. But when he unexpectedly meets twelve year old Abra Stone who possesses an even more powerful manifestation of the shining the two find their lives in sudden jeopardy at the hands of the ageless and murderous nomadic tribe known as the True Knot.","type":"string","$$hashKey":"object:1197"}],"ifs":[]}}
